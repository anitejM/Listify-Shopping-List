# Listify-Shopping-List
I have used PyQt6 to make a Python executable file in which one can add items to their shopping list, and put the quantity and cost of it.
At the end the total will be given, and the user can then choose to copy the list to their clipboard or save the list in tabular form in a Word document as per their wish.
